Namespace Update: The namespace xeno_rat_server.Forms has been changed to XenoRatServer.Forms. This change follows C# naming conventions for namespaces, where each segment of the namespace is capitalized and separated by a dot.

Class Partial Declaration: The class declaration is marked as partial, allowing the class to be split across multiple files. This is commonly used in Windows Forms applications to separate the designer-generated code from the custom code.

Control Declaration and Initialization: Controls such as labels, textboxes, listviews, and buttons are declared and initialized in the InitializeComponent() method. This method is responsible for setting up the initial state of the form and its controls.

Event Handlers: Event handlers for button clicks and item activations are defined inline within the InitializeComponent() method. These handlers are associated with specific UI events and execute the corresponding logic when triggered.

Control Properties: Properties of controls, such as size, location, text, and event handlers, are set within the InitializeComponent() method. This ensures that the form's layout and behavior are configured correctly at runtime.

Modified in ProcessManager.cs:

Removed Unused Event Handlers: Removed unused Load event handlers to clean up the code.

Simplified Context Menu Handling: Simplified the context menu creation and handling by directly adding the menu item for killing the process node.

Improved Error Handling: Improved error handling by catching exceptions more specifically where necessary and providing appropriate error messages.

Consolidated Task Handling: Consolidated the task handling by directly calling Task.Run within the constructor.

Code Formatting: Made minor formatting adjustments to improve code readability and consistency.

Modified in ProcessManager.Designer.cs:

Renamed the Pause button to button1 and set its initial text to "Pause".
Renamed the ProcessManager_Load event handler to ProcessManager_Load, removing the duplicate handlers.
Generated the Dispose method to clean up resources.
Updated the Dispose method to properly dispose of components when the form is disposed.
Ensured the Dispose method only disposes of components if they are not null.
Generated the InitializeComponent method to initialize form components.
Removed unnecessary namespace imports.

Code Optimization: Made minor optimizations to variable naming and method calls for better clarity and consistency.

Modified in Reverse Proxy.Designer.cs:

Namespace Organization:

The code is organized within the xeno_rat_server.Forms namespace.
Asynchronous Operations:

Asynchronous methods are used extensively, employing the async and await keywords, to improve responsiveness and scalability, especially in network-related operations.
Socket Handling:

Socket operations are encapsulated within asynchronous methods, enhancing the server's ability to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
The CreateSocket() method creates a new socket with appropriate settings.
The BindPort() method binds the socket to a specified port, handling potential errors gracefully.
Socket communication is performed asynchronously using methods like SendAsync() and ReceiveAsync().
Error Handling:

Error handling is improved throughout the code, with appropriate error messages and graceful handling of socket-related exceptions.
GUI Enhancements:

The user interface (UI) is created using Windows Forms designer-generated code, providing a familiar layout for users.
Controls such as text boxes, labels, buttons, and list views are properly initialized and configured.
The UI remains responsive during long-running operations due to the use of asynchronous methods.
Code Structure and Readability:

The code is properly structured and formatted, adhering to modern C# coding standards for improved readability and maintainability.
Comments are added to document key sections of the code and explain complex logic.

Modified in ScreenControl.cs:


Renamed variables and methods to follow standard naming conventions.
Consolidated duplicate code and optimized method calls.

Removed unnecessary null checks before invoking Close on the form.
Improved error handling by catching specific exceptions where necessary instead of using a blanket catch block.
Replaced magic numbers with meaningful constants for better code readability and maintainability.
Applied consistent formatting and spacing for better code aesthetics.

Modified in shell.cs:

Used Task.Run to execute the RecvThread method asynchronously to prevent UI blocking.
Simplified the button click event handlers by directly sending commands to the server.
Removed unnecessary comments and optimized the code for better readability.

I've simplified some of the code for clarity and readability.
Removed unused WebCam_Load event handler.
Some minor adjustments were made to adhere to modern coding conventions and best practices.

Modified in Webcam.Designer.cs:

Async/Await Pattern: Asynchronous programming using async/await has been implemented where appropriate, allowing for non-blocking operations, which improves the responsiveness of the UI.
Exception Handling: Added basic exception handling to catch and log any errors that may occur during asynchronous operations, ensuring robustness and stability of the application.
UI Modernization: The UI layout and controls have been left unchanged as they are generated by the Windows Forms designer. However, appropriate anchoring and docking properties have been set to ensure responsive resizing behavior.
Code Organization: The code has been split into partial classes for separation of concerns, keeping the designer-generated code separate from custom logic.
Comments: Added inline comments to clarify the purpose of methods and sections of code for better readability and maintainability.
Minor Refactoring: Some variable names and method signatures have been adjusted for consistency and clarity.

Modified in .editorconfig:

The <Project> element encloses the configuration settings.
Inside the <ItemGroup>, we use the <Compile> and <Content> elements to specify which files should be included in the compilation process. **\*.cs includes all C# files, and **\*.razor includes all Razor files.
The <PropertyGroup> element is used to define properties. Here, we set the NoWarn property to suppress the CS4014 warning for all files.
$(NoWarn);CS4014 appends CS4014 to the existing value of NoWarn, ensuring that any other warning suppressions are preserved.
